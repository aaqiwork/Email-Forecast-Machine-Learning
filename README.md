# Email-Forecast-Machine-Learning
A machine learning model which uses NLP to read emails and classify them as good or bad on a 0-5 scale and then predict if these customers will convert or not and then forecast sales and profit for the week/month/year.
## Model Precision
As you can see my prediction model does pretty well in forecasting the sales with a average deviation of 5.8 % .
